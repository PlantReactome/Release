urokinase plasminogen activator (two-chain):uPAR + plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) -> PAI-1:urokinase plasminogen activator (two-chain):uPAR
urokinase plasminogen activator (two-chain):uPAR + plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) -> PAI-2:urokinase plasminogen activator (two-chain):uPAR
urokinase plasminogen activator + urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) -> urokinase plasminogen activator:uPAR
vWF binds to collagen
valine + alpha-ketoglutarate <=> alpha-ketoisovalerate + glutamate [cytosolic]
valine + alpha-ketoglutarate <=> alpha-ketoisovalerate + glutamate [mitochondrial]
vitamin K epoxide -> vitamin K hydroquinone
xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP) + L-glutamine + ATP + H2O => guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) + L-glutamate + adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) + pyrophosphate
xylulose 5-phosphate + D-erythrose 4-phosphate <=> D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + D-fructose 6-phosphate
{(1,6)-alpha-glucosyl}poly{(1,4)-alpha-glucosyl}glycogenin-1 => poly{(1,4)-alpha-glucosyl} glycogenin-1 + alpha-D-glucose
{(1,6)-alpha-glucosyl}poly{(1,4)-alpha-glucosyl}glycogenin-2 => poly{(1,4)-alpha-glucosyl} glycogenin-2 + alpha-D-glucose
